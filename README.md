Currency Widget Demo
### v1.1
* This application includes a widget that displays currency infos every 1 minute.
* Since UIKit does not support widgets for now, I used SwiftUI components to design it.
* At the moment, it only includes widget design. HTTP requests will be added once I find a free currency API and some free time :)
* Widgets also contains 4 shortcuts, they're all connected to application with link but now they only open application and print their titles to console.
* Shortcut feature also will be added in the future.
